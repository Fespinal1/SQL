#In this SQL, I'm querying a database using numerous tables to compute statistics about customers and orders data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID), Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum, orderID
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id=feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderID)=6;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, ROUND(SUM(Quantity)*price,2) Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product <> ''
AND Product <> 'Product'
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price, Product, location, Quantity
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT avg(Quantity*price), COUNT (DISTINCT(acctnum))
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id=feb.orderID
WHERE length(order_id)=6
AND Quantity>2;

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
select Product, sum(Quantity), location
from FebSales
Where location Like '%Los Angeles%'
Group by product
